NAME
    Gedcom - a class to manipulate Gedcom genealogy files

    Version 1.01 - 27th April 1999

DESCRIPTION
    Copyright 1998-1999, Paul Johnson (pjcj@transeda.com)

    This software is free. It is licensed under the same terms as Perl
    itself.

    The latest version of this software should be available from my
    homepage: http://www.transeda.com/pjcj

    This module provides for manipulation of Gedcom files. Gedcom is a
    format for storing genealogical information designed by The Church of
    Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (http://www.lds.org). Information
    about Gedcom is available as a zip file at
    ftp://gedcom.org/pub/genealogy/gedcom/gedcom55.zip. Unfortunately, this
    is only usable if you can access a PC running Windows of some
    description. Part of the reason I wrote this module is because I don't
    do that.

    The Gedcom format is specified in a grammar file (gedcom-5.5.grammar).
    Gedcom.pm parses the grammar which is then used to validate and allow
    manipulation of the Gedcom file. I have only used Gedcom.pm with version
    5.5 of the Gedcom grammar, which I had to modify slightly to correct a
    few errors. The advantage of this approach is that Gedcom.pm should be
    useful if the Gedcom grammar is ever updated. It also made the software
    easier to write, and probably more dependable too. I suppose this is the
    virtue of laziness shining through.

    The vice of laziness is also shining brightly - I need to document how
    to use this module in much greater detail. This is happening - this
    release has more docuemntation than previously - but if you would like
    information feel free to send me mail.

    This module provides some functions which work over the entire Gedcom
    file, such as reformatting dates, renumbering entries and ordering the
    entries. It also allows acces to individuals, and then to relations of
    individuals, for example sons, siblings, spouse, parents and so forth.

    Note that this is an early release of this software - caveat emptor.

    Should you find this software useful, or if you make changes to it, or
    if you would like me to make changes to it, please send me mail. I would
    like to have some sort of an idea of the use this software is getting.
    Apart from being of interest to me, this will guide my decisions when I
    feel the need to make changes to the interface.

    I couldn't find a nice free program I could use to enter my genealogy,
    and so I wrote a syntax file (ged.vim) and used vim (http://www.vim.org)
    to enter the data, and Gedcom.pm to validate and manipulate it. I find
    this to be a nice solution.
